    <h2>Tavis Nelson</h2>
    <p>I am Tavis Nelson. I am studying Computer Science in hopes of going into web development. 
        I love playing disc golf in my spare time. I have two wonderful daughters and an amazing 
        wife of 6 years and counting. Currently, I work in the solar industry but cannot wait to 
        finish school and find something I can really be passionate about. </p>
    <p>Through this class I hope to learn about how websites are created so I can make steps towards
        my desired career in web development. Since I am just starting to learn html right now and
        have only done a bit of coding in python before I want to take more strides in getting comfortable
        with coding in general. </p>
